In particular, we will look at the XGBoost sentiment analysis model that we constructed earlier. In this case, however, we have some new data that our model doesn't seem to perform very well on. As a result, we will re-train our model and update an existing endpoint so that it uses our new model.\n",

I was just a little kid at the time, but I loved it and wasn\\'t really that scared by it. I thought it had such a cool and highly original storyline. Thinking back, I\\'m still surprised that it was shown during the day on T.V. uncut in those years. I\\'ve sought out this film ever since, seen it over and over again, and always loved it. One would think John Waters would have idolized this film. It\\'s got to be not only a scary film, but one of the sleaziest, trashiest films ever made at that time. And surprisingly, you don\\'t hear about this one as having the cult following that a movie such as \"Blood Feast\" or \"The Hills Have Eyes\" have acquired over the years. It has a cult following, but it should have really become a cult classic, in my opinion. As far as I know, this came out a little before Blood Feast came out, making this probably one of the first true \"gore\" films. In fact, this movie has elements of Hershell Gordon Lewis AND a little Russ Meyer thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend this for anyone who likes trashy, sleazy, black and white horror films from the early \\'60\\'s (I think the date at the end of it read 1960).'"

That is, we don't necessarily need to use our model's results immediately and instead we can peform inference on a large number of samples. An example of this in industry might be peforming an end of month report. This method of inference can also be useful to us as it means to can perform inference on our entire test set. \n",
